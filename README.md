# In the End Times There Shall Be Pestilences – COVID-19 and Bible Prophecy

The Lord Jesus Christ warned that in the last days there would be **pestilences** along with wars and earthquakes (Matthew 24:7, KJV). The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how vulnerable the world is to global disease outbreaks.

This article reflects on:
- The meaning of “pestilences” in Bible prophecy  
- Why COVID-19 may be only the beginning  
- The social, economic, and health impacts of pandemics  
- How Scripture points to even deadlier pestilences during the Tribulation  

This repository offers a short introduction to the theme. The full article with detailed explanation and Scripture references is available on my blog.

## Why This Matters
Understanding end-times pestilences helps believers:

- Recognize the fragility of human systems  
- Turn to the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation and eternal hope
